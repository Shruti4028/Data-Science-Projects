Advanced E-commerce Analytics and Sales Prediction
Problem Statement:
This project focuses on advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) and sales prediction for an e-commerce dataset. The analysis employs sophisticated techniques to uncover multivariate relationships, explore temporal patterns, perform geospatial analysis, and utilize advanced correlation methods.

Key Features:
Multivariate Analysis: Utilize techniques like parallel coordinates plots for insightful analysis of relationships between multiple numerical variables.

Time Series Analysis: Explore temporal patterns using seasonal decomposition, autocorrelation, and advanced distribution modeling.

Geospatial Analysis: Visualize sales patterns across different regions using maps and heatmaps for enhanced insights.

Hierarchical Clustering: Group similar products or categories based on sales patterns and analyze relationships within clusters.

Distribution Analysis: Model the distribution of sales using advanced statistical distributions.

Interactive Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards with Plotly or Tableau for dynamic exploration of data patterns.

Feature Engineering and Selection:
Dimensionality Reduction: Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce features while preserving essential information.

Feature Importance Analysis: Use techniques like recursive feature elimination with cross-validation to identify and select relevant features.

Outlier Detection and Treatment:
Advanced Outlier Detection: Apply sophisticated algorithms like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor.

Anomaly Detection: Implement techniques for identifying unusual patterns or behaviors in sales data.
